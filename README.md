# SQL Injection Vulnerability Web Application Lab üöÄ

Welcome to the **SQL Injection (SQLi) Vulnerability Web Application Lab**! This project simulates common SQL Injection vulnerabilities and provides an environment for penetration testing and security awareness. Below, you'll find detailed instructions to get the project up and running on your local machine.

## üõ†Ô∏è **Installation & Setup**

### **Prerequisites**

Before you start, ensure that the following are installed on your system:

- **XAMPP** (or any local PHP & MySQL environment)
- A **web browser** (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.)
- **Burp Suite** (optional but recommended for vulnerability testing)

---

### **Setting Up XAMPP** üîß

1. **Download & Install XAMPP**  
   - Head over to the official [XAMPP website](https://www.apachefriends.org) and download the installer for your operating system.
   - Install the software by following the on-screen instructions.

2. **Start Apache and MySQL Services**  
   - Open the XAMPP Control Panel.
   - Start **Apache** and **MySQL** to enable the web server and database server.

3. **Place Project Files in the `htdocs` Directory**  
   - Extract the project folder.
   - Move the project folder to `\xampp\htdocs\`.

### **Setting Up the Database** üíª

1. **Open phpMyAdmin**  
   - In your browser, navigate to: `http://localhost/phpmyadmin/`.

2. **Import the Database**  
   - Click on the **Import** tab in phpMyAdmin.
   - Choose the `127_0_0_1.sql.zip` file provided in the project.
   - Hit the **Go** button to import the database into MySQL.

3. **Verify the Database**  
   - Ensure that the **employee** database is created and contains necessary tables like `users`, `employee`, `department`, etc.

---

### **Configuring Database Connection** üîë

1. **Open `dbconnection.php`**  
   - Open the `dbconnection.php` file in your favorite text editor.
   - Ensure that the database credentials match your local MySQL setup (host, username, password).
   - Save the changes and close the file.
